## Welcome to my Homepage

I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Michigan State University, working in the Mathematics group led by Prof. Qian Jiangliang.
I am currently working on **numerical micro-local analysis**, forward modeling of **elastic-acoustic interface** and an **inverse problem for elastic wave equation**.

I graduated in August 2017 from the Chinese University of Hong Kong with a PhD in Mathematics under the supervision of Prof. Eric T. Chung.

During my five year PhD study, with my supervisor Eric T. Chung and other collaborators, I had developed a **staggered discontinuous Garlerkin method** for **elastic wave propagation**. Also, during my visit to the Brown university in 2016, I had devise a **phased-based IPDG method for Helmholtz equation**, which use wave-like function as basis instead of polynomials.

I have built various solvers for different problems using **Matlab**, including the SDG methods for elastic wave equations and its strong symmetry version, a SDG Stokes solver with motar formulation, an phase-based IPDG solver for the Helmholtz equation.

Currently, I am particularly interested in Machine learning, Numerical analysis, Scientific Computing and Wave propagation.
